Capacity and Material
---------------------

This tool has a **MAXIMUM CAPACITY** of 1/4" x 12" MILD STEEL ONLY.

Operation
---------
.. include:: <isonum.txt>

1. Hold short material with tongs or similar devices.

2. When using the brake, make sure to load the brake centrally (visual centering is sufficient).  If work is performed off-center, the guide pins could become damaged.  The brake lift is provided by springs.  If sticking occurs at the bottom of the stroke and the upper die does not return, usually a slight tap on the upper die is sufficient to free the guides.

3. Adjust the :doc:`stroke control <stroke>` if the required bend is less than 90|deg|.

4. Make sure the `selector arm`_ is in the **SHEAR** position.

5. Depress the foot pedal until the desired bend is achieved.
