Overview
--------

The stroke control can be used to eliminate excessive free travel and increase productivity.  Also, in tools such as the :doc:`tubing notcher <tubenotcher>` the stroke control needs to be used to ensure proper clearance and safety.

Operation
---------

With the `selector arm in the **SHEAR** position`_, the top stroke control lever will determine how low the shear will go and the lower lever will determine how high up the shear will go.  Use the `shear foot pedal`_ to operate the bar shear, angle shear, brake, and tube notcher.

With the `selector arm in the **PUNCH** position`_, the top stroke control lever will determine how high the punch will go and the lower stroke control will determine how low the punch will go.  Use the `punch foot pedal`_ to operate the punches and coper notcher.
