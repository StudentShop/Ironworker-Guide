Overview
--------

Apply `Tap Magic`_ to the upper and lower blades before the first cut is made and every 10 to 15 cuts, thereafter.  This reduces cutting tonnage and increases blade life.  The `selector arm`_ must be in the **SHEAR** position to operate this tool.

Capacity and Material
---------------------

The capacity for this tool is as follows:

4\ |quot| x 4\ |quot| x 3\/8\ |quot| at 90\ |deg| and 2\ |quot| x 2\ |quot| x 3\/8\ |quot| at 45\ |deg| **MILD STEEL ONLY!**

.. warning:: Stainless steel and hardened steel are **NOT** to be cut on the angle shear!
.. Note:: Only cut equal leg length angle iron on this machine. e.g., 1\ |quot| x 1\ |quot|, 2\ |quot| x 2\ |quot|, 3\ |quot| x 3\ |quot|, etc.

Operation
---------

Use the following steps when using the Angle Shear tool:

1. Feed the workpiece through the tool, keeping it horizontal with the tool.

2. The :doc:`downstroke <stroke>` of the machine should be set for the size of the material being sheared.

3. Depress the foot pedal and shear the material.  **Make sure you clear the slug from between the blades before moving onto the next cut!**


Mitering
--------

To cut a 30\ |deg| or 45\ |deg| miter cut on angle iron, use the following steps:

1. Move the metal peg on the front of the angle shear to the upper postion \(45\ |deg|\) or lower position \(30\ |deg|\) depending on your needs

2. Lift up the guard on the angle shear

3. Slide the angle iron into the shear as shown in the above figure

4. Press down onto the foot pedal until the angle iron is completely sheared.

.. note:: The maximum material for mitering is 2\ |quot| x 2\ |quot| x 3\/8\ |quot| at 45\ |deg| **MILD STEEL ONLY!**
