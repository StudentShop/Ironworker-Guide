The tubing notcher is a component tool designed to saddle cut pipe or tubing for applications such as railings.  

Capacity and Materials
----------------------

1 1/4" Schedule 40 (.140" wall thickness) and 1 1/2" Schedule 40 (.145" wall thickness) are the maximum sizes that can be cut on this tool.

.. warning:: **No stainless steel or chrome-moly (4130, 4140) is allowed on this tool**

.. note:: Make sure you have the correct dies for your tubing size.  If not, ask the student shop staff to swap out the dies for you.

Operation
---------

The operation of the tubing notcher consists of the following basic steps:

1.	Make sure that the `stroke control`_ is set so that the `upper die only goes below the lower die`_ by 1/32".  This is **VERY** important.

2.	Apply `Tap Magic`_ to the blades before making the first cut and every 10 to 15 cuts, thereafter.  This will reduce cutting tonnage and increase blade life.

3.	Apply way oil to the back and sides of the upper die.

4.	The `selector arm`_ must be in the **SHEAR** position.

5.	Place the tube over the upper cutting die and resting on the lower die.

6.	Keep your hands clear of all moving parts.

7.	Depress the foot pedal and make the shear stroke.

8.	Rotate the tube 180|deg|.

9.	Depress the foot pedal and make the shear stroke.
